Two hearts, one valve
Pumping the blood, we were the flood
We were the body and
Two lives, one life
Sticking it out, letting you down
Making it right

Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Change will make you cry, cry, cry
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die

I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again
-------------------------------------
Sunsets, sunrises
Living the dream, watching the leaves
Changing the seasons
Some nights, I think of you
Reliving the past, wishing it'd last
Wishing and dreaming
